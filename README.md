Pokemon clone in Python+PyGame
------------------------------

### Requirements
Python 2.6 and [PyGame 1.9.1 for py2.6](http://pygame.org/ftp/).

### Usage
To start the demo, type `python main.py` at the command line while inside the py-kmon directory.

### Controls
The arrow keys move your character. Holding space will disable the frame limiter, allowing you to walk quickly if you have a good processor. Holding r will record the window's output to the caps folder.

### Maps
You can make your own maps using [tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/). Open one of the provided tmx files in tiled to get an idea of how to set up blocking volumes, moving NPCs, and boulders. The tileset images are included in the repo.
